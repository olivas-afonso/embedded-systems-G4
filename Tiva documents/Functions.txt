10.2.1.28 ROM_GPIOPinWrite
Writes a value to the specified pin(s).
Prototype:
void
ROM_GPIOPinWrite(uint32_t ui32Port,
uint8_t ui8Pins,
uint8_t ui8Val)

ROM Location:
ROM_APITABLE is an array of pointers located at 0x0100.0010.
ROM_GPIOTABLE is an array of pointers located at ROM_APITABLE[4].
ROM_GPIOPinWrite is a function pointer located at ROM_GPIOTABLE[0].
Parameters:
ui32Port is the base address of the GPIO port.
ui8Pins is the bit-packed representation of the pin(s).
ui8Val is the value to write to the pin(s).
Description:
Writes the corresponding bit values to the output pin(s) specified by ui8Pins. Writing to a pin
configured as an input pin has no effect.
The pin(s) are specified using a bit-packed byte, where each bit that is set identifies the pin to
be accessed, and where bit 0 of the byte represents GPIO port pin 0, bit 1 represents GPIO
port pin 1, and so on.
Returns:
None.


15.2.1.18 ROM_PWMGenPeriodSet
Set the period of a PWM generator.
Prototype:
void
ROM_PWMGenPeriodSet(uint32_t ui32Base,
uint32_t ui32Gen,
uint32_t ui32Period)
ROM Location:
ROM_APITABLE is an array of pointers located at 0x0100.0010.
ROM_PWMTABLE is an array of pointers located at ROM_APITABLE[8].
ROM_PWMGenPeriodSet is a function pointer located at ROM_PWMTABLE[2].
Parameters:
ui32Base is the base address of the PWM module.
ui32Gen is the PWM generator to be modified. Must be one of PWM_GEN_0, PWM_GEN_1,
PWM_GEN_2, or PWM_GEN_3.
ui32Period specifies the period of PWM generator output, measured in clock ticks.
Description:
This function sets the period of the specified PWM generator block, where the period of the
generator block is defined as the number of PWM clock ticks between pulses on the generator
block zero signal.
Note:
Any subsequent calls made to this function before an update occurs will cause the previous
values to be overwritten.
Returns:
None
